You can define environments within GitHub for better management of approvals:
	1.	Go to your repositoryâ€™s Settings > Environments.
	2.	Add environments such as dev, staging, and prod.
	3.	For each environment, you can require manual approval before the job runs, linking to the steps in the workflow.
